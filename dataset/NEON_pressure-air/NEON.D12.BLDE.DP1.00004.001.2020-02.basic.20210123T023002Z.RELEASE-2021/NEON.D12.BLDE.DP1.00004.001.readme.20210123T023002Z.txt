DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00004.001

Name: Barometric pressure

Description: Barometric pressure is available as one- and thirty-minute averages for station pressure, which is determined from 0.1 Hz observations. Barometric pressure corrected to sea level and surface level (defined as water surface at aquatic sites and soil surface at terrestrial sites) is derived from station pressure averages and available at one- and thirty-minute increments. Observations are made by a single digital barometer located on the tower infrastructure and a single digital barometer located on the aquatic meteorological station.

NEON Science Team Supplier: Terrestrial Instrument System

Abstract: Barometric pressure, or static atmospheric pressure, is a vital measurement for NEON. Barometric pressure is significant in influencing weather conditions as well as aqueous chemistry (e.g. the amount of gas that can dissolve in solution). Recording static atmospheric pressure will allow atmospheric gas mixing ratios to be converted into mass quantities. Barometric pressure will be recorded over NEONâ€™s entire operational range.

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.

Brief Design Description: Barometric pressure will be recorded at a rate of 0.1 Hz for L0 DPs, and these L0 DPs will be used to calculate the L1 DPs, one- and thirty-minute averages of station and sea level pressure, as well as one- minute averages of soil plot pressure.

Brief Study Area Description: At terrestrial sites the pressure sensor will be located on the tower infrastructure at a site specific installation height (h) above ground level (AGL). At aquatic sites the pressure sensor will be located on a field-based met station (tripod) at a standard installation height of above ground level. Lake sites will have an additional pressure sensor located on a buoy at a standard installation height above water level (AWL), but at a different sampling frequency and that data will be handled in a separate ATBD. Therefore, barometric (station) pressure will represent the point in space at which the barometer is located.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via NEON's data portal or API. Please visit https://www.neonscience.org/data-formats-conventions for a full description of the naming conventions.

Issue Date: 2020-03-26
Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment will be entered at that time.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

NEON data are initially published with a status of Provisional, in which updates to data and/or processing algorithms will occur on an as-needed basis, and query reproducibility cannot be guaranteed.
